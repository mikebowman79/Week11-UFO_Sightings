# Week11-UFO_Sightings

UFOs
Overview
The purpose of this project was to build a webpage containing data regarding several UFO sightings. The data captures the date, city, state, and country of the sighting. Also captured is the shape of the sighting, duration of the sighting, and any comments and observations about the UFO sightings. With this webpage, users from around the world can sift through the data and come to their own conclusions regarding the existence of extraterrestrial life. The webpage is very user friendly and provides some background information into the research that has gone into collecting the data as well as opposing viewpoints from experts in the field.



Results
Upon opening the webpage and scrolling past the narrative, all data regarding sightings is presented and ordered by date. Users can filter the data by entering a date, city, state, country, or UFO shape into the search fields. This will populate a list of sightings matching the search field.



In the below image, the date field was searched by 1/10/2010 and a list of all sightings on 1/10/2010 was populated.



Multiple fields can be searched simultaneously. In the below image, the search fields selected are “US” for country and “circle” for shape. This populates a filtered list of all sightings of a circle shaped UFO in the US.



Summary
A drawback of this page Is that there is not a search field for duration of UFO sightings. This would be an interesting field to add and to search alongside with the other fields. However, that data would need to be cleaned to be consistent since currently the data is presented in different time formats (minutes, mins, seconds, numerical, etc).

Two improvements I would make to this webpage are with the search function. Firstly, I think that a “search” button should be added as opposed to waiting for the data to either auto populate or clicking away if you’re impatient like me. Secondly, I would add both a “clear search” button to clear all fields as well as “x” in each field if the user only wants to clear one field. Not all users are computer savvy and might not realize to go into the field and manually delete the searched term.

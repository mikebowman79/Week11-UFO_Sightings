# Week11-UFO_Sightings

UFOs
Overview

The purpose of the UFO Sightings Project was to build a webpage containing data regarding UFO sightings; the data encompassed the year 2010 of sightings throughout the US, from as far west as California and as far east as New York and New Jersey. Additional data was taken recording the city, state and country of each occurance as well as the shape, duration (time) of each sighting along with any additional comments. 

Results
Upon opening the webpage and scrolling past the narrative, all data regarding sightings is presented and ordered by date. Users can filter the data by the parameters mentioned above.  This will populate a list of sightings matching the inputed search fields.

Examples of what the webpage looks like are shown below determined by each of the filters and entering "Enter" from the user keyboard:

a. Date: Initial view- All dates are as of 1/10/2010; this date remains a constant on the page

b. City: 

c. State: 

d. Country: 

e. Shape: 


Multiple Filters: Multiple fields can be searched simultaneously. In the below image, the search fields selected are “City” for country and “Triangle” for shape. This populates a filtered list of all sightings of a triangle shaped UFO in the US.



Drawbacks of the webpage are the following: 

a. Submit Button: There is no "Submit" button to enter values for each of the filters
b. Clear Button: A "Clear" button needs to be introduced so prior results can be deleted for the next filtered attempt.
